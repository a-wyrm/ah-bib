	abstract = {To successfully manage security and privacy threats, users must be able to perceive the relevant information. However, a number of accessibility obstacles impede the access of such information for users with visual disabilities, and could mislead them into incorrectly assessing their security and privacy. We explore how these users protect their online security and privacy. We observed their behaviours when navigating Gmail, Amazon, and a phishing site imitating CNIB, a well-known organization for our participants. We further investigate their real world concerns through semi-structured interviews. Our analysis uncovered severe usability issues which led users to engage in risky behaviours or to compromise between accessibility or security. Our work conﬁrms the ﬁndings from related literature and provides novel insights, such as how software for security (e.g., antivirus) and accessibility (e.g., JAWS) can hinder users’ abilities to identify risks. We organize our main ﬁndings around four states of security and privacy experienced by users while completing sensitive tasks, and provide design recommendations for communicating security and privacy information to users with visual disabilities.},

However, the unique privacy and security needs of visually impaired people remain largely unaddressed. We conducted an exploratory user study with 14 visually impaired participants to understand the techniques they currently use for protecting privacy, their remaining privacy concerns, and how new technologies may be able to help. The interviews explored privacy not only in the physical world (e.g., bystanders overhearing private conversations) and the online world (e.g., determining if a URL is legitimate), but also in the interface between the two (e.g. bystanders ‘shoulder-surﬁng’ data from screens). The study revealed serious concerns that are not adequately solved by current technology, and suggested new directions for improving the privacy of this signiﬁcant fraction of the population.},

“To answer these questions, we conducted an exploratory user study through semi-structured in-person interviews with visually impaired people (N =14). We explored their privacy concerns, needs, and behaviors in three main settings: physical, online, and at the interface between the two (e.g. privacy leaks that occur when using technology in public).” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“One recurring theme in their responses was that being forced to depend on other people, especially strangers, was a major privacy risk.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“More research on the social consequences of assistive technologies is needed, since their success may depend on overcoming these social barriers.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“In this paper we more broadly study privacy-enhancing concerns, behaviors, and tools used throughout everyday life, in addition to online concerns.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“Privacy concerns and behaviors. We asked participants to describe their physical and virtual privacy concerns, and any privacy-enhancing behaviors they use. We also asked about specific topics, such as whether participants had any concerns about assistive devices, about people watching them, and about their comfort in requesting assistance.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 3)“Lack of Independence” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 3)“For example, most participants were extremely cautious with home security, like hesitating to open the door when someone knocks unless they were expecting someone or recognized the person’s voice.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 5)“Like other populations, people with visual impairments use devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and personal computers. In fact, many participants said that these devices help them communicate and achieve greater independence. However, these devices also create privacy risks because of the vast amounts of personal data they store, and poor visual acuity makes it harder to safeguard this information.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 5)“Like everyone, visually impaired people run into problems with their computing devices or need to learn how to use a new device, and require assistance either from technical support staff or from others.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 6)“After posting content, it can be difficult for visually impaired users to confirm that the privacy settings are correct. P3 mentioned once trying to send a photo to specific friends and family but mistakenly made it public. He only realized this mistake when an unintended viewer commented on the photo.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 6)“Most participants indicated that they address physical privacy concerns by requesting help from acquaintances. While some could depend on a sighted spouse to read their letters, for instance, others asked friends or acquaintances or relied on a scanner.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 6)“We thought visually impaired people might want a device to detect cameras, since sighted people can notice them and modify their behavior accordingly. P4 disliked this idea, saying that knowing about security cameras would make her feel paranoid.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 8)“Of course, an effective device would have to communicate information efficiently to the user, and a system that provides too many notifications could overwhelm and annoy the user. One solution would be to allow the user to provide privacy policies that could be executed automatically, depending on context. For example, a policy could turn off the screen and stop announcing emails if a bystander is nearby. Another policy could suppress all notifications in the home, except for emergencies like when an intruder is detected.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 9)

Our study results provide rich and nuanced accounts of how people with visual impairments enact their privacy/security in daily life, inﬂuenced by both their interactions with their allies and multiple (marginalized) dimensions of their identities such as different disabilities. We also found that people with visual impairments often work closely with their allies to protect their privacy and security in a cooperative manner. However, they were also thoughtful about who they would ask for help in part due to privacy reasons, even if they are trustworthy family members. We discuss ideas for future research and design, particularly a need for designing mechanisms or tools that facilitate cooperative privacy management (e.g., between people with visual impairments and their allies).},

However, little is known about the ways in which assistive and non-assistive technologies are brought to bear on material practices. We present findings from a four-month ethnographic study facilitated by a local branch of a UK charity that supports people with visual impairments. Our study explores mainstream and assistive technology use within their everyday lives. We identify three main sites for technology use: social relations and communication practices, textual reading practices, and mobility practices. Via an ethnographic approach we contribute to understanding how people accomplish such practices, and in doing so, uncover the practical competencies that enable people with visual impairments to conduct their everyday activities. Thus we investigate how disability can be thought of in terms of competencies, arguing that understanding of competencies can enrich the design of technologies that fit the needs of people with visual impairments.},

Not a single par­ ticipant used optional authentication methods such as a password-protected screen lock. We addressed the high risk of unauthorized user access by developing PassChords, a non-visual authentication method for touch surfaces that is robust to aural and visual eavesdropping. A user enters a PassChord by tapping several times on a touch surface with one or more ﬁngers. The set of ﬁngers used in each tap deﬁnes the password. We give preliminary evidence that a four-tap PassChord has about the same entropy, a measure of password strength, as a four-digit personal identiﬁcation number (PIN) used in the iPhone’s Passcode Lock. We con­ ducted a study with 16 blind participants that showed that PassChords were nearly three times as fast as iPhone’s Passcode Lock with VoiceOver, suggesting that PassChords are a viable accessible authentication method for touch screens.},

Popular services feature volunteers who answer questions about photos or videos (e.g., to identify a medical prescription). However, people with VIPs can (inadvertently) reveal sensitive information to these volunteers. To better understand the privacy concerns regarding the disclosure of background objects to different types of human assistants (friends, family, and others), we conducted an online survey with 155 visually impaired participants. In general, our participants had varying concerns depending on the type of assistants and the kind of information. We found that our participants were more concerned about the privacy of bystanders than their own when capturing people in images. We also found that participants were concerned about self-presentation and were more comfortable sharing embarrassing information with family than with their friends. Our ﬁndings suggest directions for future work in the development of human-assisted question-answering systems.

However, PINs can be inaccessible for blind or low vision (BLV) users due to screen readers voicing PINs to bystanders or potential shoulder surfing attack risks—bystanders could watch the PIN being entered without the user noticing. To address this, we present OneButtonPIN, an interface to improve PIN entry accessibility and security for BLV users. Here, a single on-screen button, when pressed and held, triggers a haptic vibration sequence. A digit is entered by counting the vibrations and releasing the button. We explored introducing random timings to the vibration sequence to increase security. A week-long evaluation with 9 BLV participants and a security study with 10 sighted participants acting as shoulder surfers demonstrated OneButtonPIN’s usability and resilience against eavesdropping.

Every electronic account opened has a user name and password attached to it. Usually the password assigned is an arbitrary, random number given by the entity that issues the account. That means the more accounts we have, e.g. e-mail, bank account, office intranets, etc., the more passwords we must remember. Each of these passwords is an alphanumeric sequence. Since it is also recommended that we change passwords every three to six months, it could rapidly become burdensome to remember, not only all the passwords but which password goes with which account. In an effort to simplify the process, many computer users tend to select one generic password and apply it to all accounts. This then becomes a very high security risk since it becomes relatively simple to access all accounts once the first one has been breached.},

The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the developments on usability of mobile applications for people with visual impairments based on recent advances in research and application development. This overview is important to guide decision-making for researchers and provide a synthesis of available evidence and indicate in which direction it is worthwhile to prompt further research. We performed a systematic literature review on the usability of mobile applications for people with visual impairments. A deep analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for SLRs and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was performed to produce a set of relevant papers in the field. We first identified 932 papers published within the last six years. After screening the papers and employing a snowballing technique, we identified 60 studies that were then classified into seven themes: accessibility, daily activities, assistive devices, navigation, screen division layout, and audio guidance. The studies were then analyzed to answer the proposed research questions in order to illustrate the different trends, themes, and evaluation results of various mobile applications developed in the last six years. Using this overview as a foundation, future directions for research in the field of usability for the visually impaired (UVI) are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Many people who are blind take and post photos to share about their lives and connect with others. Yet, current technology does not provide blind people with accessible ways to handle when private information is unintentionally captured in their images. To explore the technology design in supporting them with this task, we developed a design probe for blind people —ImageAlly — that employs a human-AI hybrid approach to detect and redact private image content. ImageAlly notifies users when potential private information is detected in their images, using computer vision, and enables them to transfer those images to trusted sighted allies to edit the private content. In an exploratory study with pairs of blind participants and their sighted allies, we found that blind people felt empowered by ImageAlly to prevent privacy leakage in sharing images on social media. They also found other benefits from using ImageAlly, such as potentially improving their relationship with allies and giving allies the awareness of the accessibility challenges they face.},
