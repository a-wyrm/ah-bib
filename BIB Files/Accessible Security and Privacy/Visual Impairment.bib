We explored their privacy concerns, needs, and behaviors in three main settings: physical, online, and at the interface between the two (e.g. privacy leaks that occur when using technology in public).” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“One recurring theme in their responses was that being forced to depend on other people, especially strangers, was a major privacy risk.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“More research on the social consequences of assistive technologies is needed, since their success may depend on overcoming these social barriers.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“In this paper we more broadly study privacy-enhancing concerns, behaviors, and tools used throughout everyday life, in addition to online concerns.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 2)“Privacy concerns and behaviors. We asked participants to describe their physical and virtual privacy concerns, and any privacy-enhancing behaviors they use. We also asked about specific topics, such as whether participants had any concerns about assistive devices, about people watching them, and about their comfort in requesting assistance.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 3)“Lack of Independence” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 3)“For example, most participants were extremely cautious with home security, like hesitating to open the door when someone knocks unless they were expecting someone or recognized the person’s voice.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 5)“Like other populations, people with visual impairments use devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and personal computers. In fact, many participants said that these devices help them communicate and achieve greater independence. However, these devices also create privacy risks because of the vast amounts of personal data they store, and poor visual acuity makes it harder to safeguard this information.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 5)“Like everyone, visually impaired people run into problems with their computing devices or need to learn how to use a new device, and require assistance either from technical support staff or from others.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 6)“After posting content, it can be difficult for visually impaired users to confirm that the privacy settings are correct. P3 mentioned once trying to send a photo to specific friends and family but mistakenly made it public. He only realized this mistake when an unintended viewer commented on the photo.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 6)“Most participants indicated that they address physical privacy concerns by requesting help from acquaintances. While some could depend on a sighted spouse to read their letters, for instance, others asked friends or acquaintances or relied on a scanner.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 6)“We thought visually impaired people might want a device to detect cameras, since sighted people can notice them and modify their behavior accordingly. P4 disliked this idea, saying that knowing about security cameras would make her feel paranoid.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 8)“Of course, an effective device would have to communicate information efficiently to the user, and a system that provides too many notifications could overwhelm and annoy the user. One solution would be to allow the user to provide privacy policies that could be executed automatically, depending on context. For example, a policy could turn off the screen and stop announcing emails if a bystander is nearby. Another policy could suppress all notifications in the home, except for emergencies like when an intruder is detected.” (Ahmed et al., 2015, p. 9)"
