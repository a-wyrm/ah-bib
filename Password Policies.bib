	abstract = {Text-based passwords are still the most commonly used authentication mechanism in information systems. We took advantage of a unique opportunity presented by a signiﬁcant change in the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) computing services password policy that required users to change their passwords. Through our survey of 470 CMU computer users, we collected data about behaviors and practices related to the use and creation of passwords. We also captured users’ opinions about the new, stronger policy requirements. Our analysis shows that, although most of the users were annoyed by the need to create a complex password, they believe that they are now more secure. Furthermore, we perform an entropy analysis and discuss how our ﬁndings relate to NIST† recommendations for creating a password policy. We also examine how users answer speciﬁc questions related to their passwords. Our results can be helpful in designing better password policies that consider not only technical aspects of speciﬁc policy rules, but also users’ behavior in response to those rules.},

	abstract = {Password-composition policies are the result of service providers becoming increasingly concerned about the security of online accounts. These policies restrict the space of user-created passwords to preclude easily guessed passwords and thus make passwords more difficult for attackers to guess. However, many users struggle to create and recall their passwords under strict password-composition policies, for example, ones that require passwords to have at least eight characters with multiple character classes and a dictionary check. Recent research showed that a promising alternative was to focus policy requirements on password length instead of on complexity. In this work, we examine 15 password policies, many focusing on length requirements. In doing so, we contribute the first thorough examination of policies requiring longer passwords. We conducted two online studies with over 20,000 participants, and collected both usability and password-strength data. Our findings indicate that password strength and password usability are not necessarily inversely correlated: policies that lead to stronger passwords do not always reduce usability. We identify policies that are both more usable and more secure than commonly used policies that emphasize complexity rather than length requirements. We also provide practical recommendations for service providers who want their users to have strong yet usable passwords.},

While much study has been conducted on how password composition policies (sets of rules that a user must abide by when creating a password) influence the distribution of user-chosen passwords on a system, much less research has been done on inferring the password composition policy that a given set of user-chosen passwords was created under. In this paper, we state the problem with the naive approach to this challenge, and suggest a simple approach that produces more reliable results. We also present pol-infer, a tool that implements this approach, and demonstrates its use in inferring password composition policies.},

@article{horsch_password_nodate,
	title = {Password {Policy} {Markup} {Language}},
	abstract = {Password-based authentication is the most widely used authentication scheme for granting access to user accounts on the Internet. Despite this, there exists no standard implementation of passwords by services. They have different password requirements as well as interfaces and procedures for login, password change, and password reset. This situation is very challenging for users and often leads to the choice of weak passwords and prevents security-conscious behavior. Furthermore, it prevents the development of applications that provide a fully-ﬂedged assistance for users in securely generating and managing passwords. In this paper, we present a solution that bridges the gap between the different password implementations on the service-side and applications assisting users with their passwords on the client-side. First, we introduce the Password Policy Markup Language (PPML). It enables a uniformly speciﬁed Password Policy Description (PPD) for a services. A PPD describes the password requirements as well as password interfaces and procedures of a service and can be processed by applications. It enables applications to automatically (1) generate passwords in accordance with the password requirements of a service, (2) perform logins, (3) change passwords, and (4) reset passwords. Second, we present a prototypical password manager which uses PPDs and is capable of generating and completely managing passwords on behalf of users.},

	abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and ﬁnd that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

	abstract = {Password managers help users more effectively manage their passwords, yet the adoption of password generation is minimal. One explanation for this problem is that websites’ password composition policies (PCPs) can reject generated passwords, creating a usability impediment. To address this issue, we design a PCP language that websites use to describe their PCP and that managers use to generate compliant passwords. We develop this language using an iterative process involving an extensive collection of PCPs scraped from the Web. We provide libraries for adopting our PCP language into websites and password managers and build proof-of-concept prototypes to verify the real-world feasibility of our PCP language. Using a 25-person user study, we demonstrate that our language and libraries are easy to pick up and correctly use for novice developers. Finally, we replicate and extend past research evaluating Web PCPs, showing that half of PCPs fail to require passwords that resist offline attacks when considering that users prefer certain character classes when selecting their passwords.},
